# ADB-analysis

This repository contains code to reproduce the analyses from the manuscript **"Bayesian phylodynamics for developmental biology: incorporating age-dependence"** ([Preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.28.672870) on bioRxiv).

The scripts are used for:

-   validation of the BEAST2 package [ADB](https://github.com/pilarskj/ADB)

-   analysis of [intMEMOIR](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb3099) lineage recordings of mouse embryonic stem cells from Chow et al. (2021) "Imaging cell lineage with a synthetic digital recording system"
